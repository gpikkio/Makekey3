Example of usage:      $ brief  <spk_file_name>   Descriptive information about how/why/when an SPK file was created   is usually available in the "comment area" of the file. This may be   viewed using the "commnt" utility program available in all copies of   the SPICE Toolkit. Use the "-r" option to read the comments.   Example:      $ commnt -r <spk_file_name> End of aareadme_en.txt
